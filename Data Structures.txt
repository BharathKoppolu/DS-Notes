Data Structures Intro by Adrei Neagoie

Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs

What is a Data Structure?

>>Collection of values, values haves relationships among them 
or have functions applied to them
>> Each one is different in what it can do or used for
>> Each DS is specialised for it's own thing


Ex: it is a compartment or container, 

Bag, Box, file cabinet, Drawers, Fridgre, folder. 
Each of these containers is useful/specific for it's own thing

>>A unique way to organise data and retrive the data easily

Blockchain

store numbers, strings, etc

>>Arrays and objects are a form of a DS that allows us to store information

>> variables are stored in RAM. RAM loses the data once the computer turns off

>>all docs, videos, audios will be on storage called (ROM SSD or HDD)
 Persistent storage. It is slow
 
>> CPU does the work inside the computer
CPU needs access to RAM and Storage. 
It processes the info in the RAM a lot faster


Ex:
Google Chrome
when we run Google chrome. it has piece of code
var a=1;
inorder to ru google chrome, we run our cpu
when a script is run (Example here: var is declared)
 to run google chrome, it's going to hold that in RAM
 
once we turn off google chrome, if we want to access google chrome again,
 that's how the gc app is installed on Storage.
 
 Processor/CPU
 
RAM massive storage area (DS) shelves that are numbered
Each shelf has 8 cells
Allows us to run programs on computer each cell has 8 bits
8bits> 1 byte > each cell has 1 byte of storage
CPU is connected to a memory controller, 
it does the reading and writing of data in the RAM

Memory controller is connected individually to all of the shelves in RAM

We can access any shelf with out having to climb up or down
implying random access memory

Less it has to travel, faster a program can run

computers are tuned to get extra speedboost when reading memory addresses 
that are close to each other. 0 and 1 fasterr than 0 and 1000 as they 
are close to each other

Computers have CPU cache
tiny memory where it stores a copy of data that is very recent

if our system is 8 bit (11111111) - it can store 255


Our computer can only store so much info
Any number above a certain threshold will be infinity

Each data type has a no of bits associated with it
and it needs to get stored in the system
System allocates that storage and cpu reads that storage

Some Datastructures in RAM are organised right next to each other or apart
goal is to minimise the operations for the CPU to get/write the info

low level

Data Structures:

Arrays
Stacks
Queues 
Linked Lists

Trees
Tries
Graphs
Hash Tables

Algorithms

Sorting
Dynamic Programming
BFS+DFS(Searching)
Recursion


Various operations that can be performed using DS

Insertion
Deletion
Traversal - Access each data item only once to be processed
Searching - find the location of data item if it exists in the data collection
Sorting - 

Access - How to access the data
